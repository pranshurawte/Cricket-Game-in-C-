This project is a computer program that lets you play a virtual cricket game on your computer. Here's a simple explanation of what it does:

Setting Up Teams: You start by creating two teams, Team A and Team B, by picking players from a pool of available players.

Toss: The program simulates a coin toss to decide which team bats or bowls first.

Batting and Bowling: The batting team tries to score runs, while the bowling team tries to get the batting players out. Each player gets a turn to bat, and the bowler tries to bowl them out.

Innings: Each team gets one innings, where they take turns batting and bowling. An innings consists of a fixed number of balls, typically 6.

Scoring Runs: When a batter hits the ball, they score runs. The more runs they score, the better for their team.

Getting Out: If the bowler manages to get the batter out, the batter is replaced by the next player in line.

Winning: After both teams have had their innings, the program compares their scores. The team with the highest score wins the game.

In essence, it's like playing a simplified version of cricket on your computer. You control the teams' actions, and the program keeps track of scores and outcomes. It's a fun way to enjoy cricket without needing a physical cricket field or equipment!
